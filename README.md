# A-Model-to-Variable-Names-within-a-Python-Programming-Language
Welcome to the repository for "A Model to Variable Names within a Python Programming Language"! This project aims to revolutionize how we name variables in Python by using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically T5 and BERT models, to suggest contextually relevant and semantically meaningful variable names.
## Features
- Dataset Building Scripts: Scripts to build a comprehensive dataset from Python codebases.
- T5 and BERT Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art language models for generating variable name suggestions.
- Model Training and Execution: Detailed instructions for training and executing the models.
